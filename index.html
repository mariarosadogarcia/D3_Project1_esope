    <h1>The Mountain <br> in Labor</h1>
    <p>A mountain was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter. While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible calamity, out came a Mouse. <br> <b>Don’t make much ado about nothing.</b></p>

    <h1>The Bear <br>and the Two Travelers</h1>
    <p>Two men were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could.</p>

    <p>The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.” <br> Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.</p>

    <h1>The Raven <br> and the Swan</h1>
    <p>A raven saw Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage. Supposing that the Swan's splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools. But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, I could not change their color, while through want of food I have perished. <br> Change of habit can not alter Nature.</p>

    <h1>The Cat and the Cock</h1>
    <p>A cat caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. The Cat replied, “Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless;” and he made a meal of him.</p>

    <h1>The Boy and the Nettles</h1>
    <p>A boy was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying, <i>“Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.” “That was just why it stung you,”</i> said his Mother. <i>“The next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you.”</i> <br><br>Whatever you do, do with all your might.
